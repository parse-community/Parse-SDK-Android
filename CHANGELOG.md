# 1.24.1
> __WARNING__

> Avoid using this release as it contains a [naming collission bug](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-SDK-Android/issues/1028) that has been introduced in release `1.24.0` and fixed in release `1.24.2`. The bug causes the project compliation to fail due to duplicate class names for the `bolts-tasks` module when using the Facebook Android SDK or the Parse Android SDK Facebook module.
