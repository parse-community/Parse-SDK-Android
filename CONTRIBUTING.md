# Contributing to Parse SDK for Android
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Our Development Process
Most of our work will be done in public directly on GitHub. There may be changes done through our internal source control, but it will be rare and only as needed.

### `master` is unsafe
Our goal is to keep `master` stable, but there may be changes that your application may not be compatible with. We'll do our best to publicize any breaking changes, but try to use our specific releases in any production environment.

### Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests. When we get one, we'll run some Parse-specific integration tests on it first. From here, we'll need to get a core member to sign off on the changes and then merge the pull request. For API changes we may need to fix internal uses, which could cause some delay. We'll do our best to provide updates and feedback throughout the process.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
4. Add unit tests for any new code you add.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints by running `./gradlew spotlessApply`.

## Bugs
Although we try to keep developing on Parse easy, you still may run into some issues. Technical questions should be asked on [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow], and for everything else we'll be using GitHub issues.

### Known Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new issue, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

### Reporting New Issues
Not all issues are SDK issues. If you're unsure whether your bug is with the SDK or backend, you can test to see if it reproduces with our [REST API][rest-api] and [Parse API Console][parse-api-console]. If it does, you can report backend bugs [here][bug-reports].

To view the REST API network requests issued by the Parse SDK and responses from the Parse backend, please check out [OkHttp Interceptors][network-debugging-tool].  With this tool, you can either log network requests/responses to Android logcat, or log them to Chrome Debugger via Stetho.

Details are key. The more information you provide us the easier it'll be for us to debug and the faster you'll receive a fix. Some examples of useful tidbits:

* A description. What did you expect to happen and what actually happened? Why do you think that was wrong?
* A simple unit test that fails. Refer [here][tests-dir] for examples of existing unit tests. See our [README](README.md#usage) for how to run unit tests. You can submit a pull request with your failing unit test so that our CI verifies that the test fails.
* What version does this reproduce on? What version did it last work on?
* [Stacktrace or GTFO][stacktrace-or-gtfo]. In all honesty, full stacktraces with line numbers make a happy developer.
* Anything else you find relevant.
