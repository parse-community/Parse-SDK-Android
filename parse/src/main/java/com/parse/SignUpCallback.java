/**
 * A {@code SignUpCallback} is used to run code after signing up a {@link ParseUser} in a background
 * thread.
 *
 * <p>The easiest way to use a {@code SignUpCallback} is through an anonymous inner class. Override
 * the {@code done} function to specify what the callback should do after the save is complete. The
 * {@code done} function will be run in the UI thread, while the signup happens in a background
 * thread. This ensures that the UI does not freeze while the signup happens.
 *
 * <p>For example, this sample code signs up the object {@code myUser} and calls a different
 * function depending on whether the signup succeeded or not.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * myUser.signUpInBackground(new SignUpCallback() {
 *   public void done(ParseException e) {
 *     if (e == null) {
 *       myUserSignedUpSuccessfully();
 *     } else {
 *       myUserSignUpDidNotSucceed();
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 * </pre>
