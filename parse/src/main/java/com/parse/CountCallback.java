/**
 * A {@code CountCallback} is used to run code after a {@link ParseQuery} is used to count objects
 * matching a query in a background thread.
 *
 * <p>The easiest way to use a {@code CountCallback} is through an anonymous inner class. Override
 * the {@code done} function to specify what the callback should do after the count is complete. The
 * {@code done} function will be run in the UI thread, while the count happens in a background
 * thread. This ensures that the UI does not freeze while the fetch happens.
 *
 * <p>For example, this sample code counts objects of class {@code "MyClass"}. It calls a different
 * function depending on whether the count succeeded or not.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ParseQuery&lt;ParseObject&gt; query = ParseQuery.getQuery(&quot;MyClass&quot;);
 * query.countInBackground(new CountCallback() {
 *   public void done(int count, ParseException e) {
 *     if (e == null) {
 *       objectsWereCountedSuccessfully(count);
 *     } else {
 *       objectCountingFailed();
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
