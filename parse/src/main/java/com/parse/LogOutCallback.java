/**
 * A {@code LogOutCallback} is used to run code after logging out a user.
 *
 * <p>The easiest way to use a {@code LogOutCallback} is through an anonymous inner class. Override
 * the {@code done} function to specify what the callback should do after the login is complete. The
 * {@code done} function will be run in the UI thread, while the login happens in a background
 * thread. This ensures that the UI does not freeze while the save happens.
 *
 * <p>For example, this sample code logs out a user and calls a different function depending on
 * whether the log out succeeded or not.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ParseUser.logOutInBackground(new LogOutCallback() {
 *   public void done(ParseException e) {
 *     if (e == null) {
 *       logOutSuccessful();
 *     } else {
 *       somethingWentWrong();
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
