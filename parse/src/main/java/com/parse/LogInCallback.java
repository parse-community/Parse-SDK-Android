/**
 * A {@code LogInCallback} is used to run code after logging in a user.
 *
 * <p>The easiest way to use a {@code LogInCallback} is through an anonymous inner class. Override
 * the {@code done} function to specify what the callback should do after the login is complete. The
 * {@code done} function will be run in the UI thread, while the login happens in a background
 * thread. This ensures that the UI does not freeze while the save happens.
 *
 * <p>For example, this sample code logs in a user and calls a different function depending on
 * whether the login succeeded or not.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ParseUser.logInInBackground(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;, new LogInCallback() {
 *   public void done(ParseUser user, ParseException e) {
 *     if (e == null &amp;&amp; user != null) {
 *       loginSuccessful();
 *     } else if (user == null) {
 *       usernameOrPasswordIsInvalid();
 *     } else {
 *       somethingWentWrong();
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
