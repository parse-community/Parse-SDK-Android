/**
 * Provides utility functions for working with Anonymously logged-in users. Anonymous users have
 * some unique characteristics:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Anonymous users don't need a user name or password.</li>
 * <li>Once logged out, an anonymous user cannot be recovered.</li>
 * <li>When the current user is anonymous, the following methods can be used to switch to a
 * different user or convert the anonymous user into a regular one:
 * <ul>
 * <li>signUp converts an anonymous user to a standard user with the given username and password.
 * Data associated with the anonymous user is retained.</li>
 * <li>logIn switches users without converting the anonymous user. Data associated with the
 * anonymous user will be lost.</li>
 * <li>Service logIn (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) will attempt to convert the anonymous user into a
 * standard user by linking it to the service. If a user already exists that is linked to the
 * service, it will instead switch to the existing user.</li>
 * <li>Service linking (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) will convert the anonymous user into a standard user
 * by linking it to the service.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
