/**
 * A {@code SendCallback} is used to run code after sending a {@link ParsePush} in a background
 * thread.
 *
 * <p>The easiest way to use a {@code SendCallback} is through an anonymous inner class. Override
 * the {@code done} function to specify what the callback should do after the send is complete. The
 * {@code done} function will be run in the UI thread, while the send happens in a background
 * thread. This ensures that the UI does not freeze while the send happens.
 *
 * <p>For example, this sample code sends the message {@code "Hello world"} on the {@code "hello"}
 * channel and logs whether the send succeeded.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ParsePush push = new ParsePush();
 * push.setChannel(&quot;hello&quot;);
 * push.setMessage(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);
 * push.sendInBackground(new SendCallback() {
 *   public void done(ParseException e) {
 *     if (e == null) {
 *       Log.d(&quot;push&quot;, &quot;success!&quot;);
 *     } else {
 *       Log.d(&quot;push&quot;, &quot;failure&quot;);
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 * </pre>
