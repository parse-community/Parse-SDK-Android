/**
 * A {@code FunctionCallback} is used to run code after {@link ParseCloud#callFunction} is used to
 * run a Cloud Function in a background thread.
 *
 * <p>The easiest way to use a {@code FunctionCallback} is through an anonymous inner class.
 * Override the {@code done} function to specify what the callback should do after the cloud
 * function is complete. The {@code done} function will be run in the UI thread, while the fetch
 * happens in a background thread. This ensures that the UI does not freeze while the fetch happens.
 *
 * <p>For example, this sample code calls a cloud function {@code "MyFunction"} with {@code params}
 * and calls a different function depending on whether the function succeeded.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ParseCloud.callFunctionInBackground(&quot;MyFunction&quot;new, params, FunctionCallback<ParseObject>() {
 *   public void done(ParseObject object, ParseException e) {
 *     if (e == null) {
 *       cloudFunctionSucceeded(object);
 *     } else {
 *       cloudFunctionFailed();
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of object returned by the Cloud Function.
