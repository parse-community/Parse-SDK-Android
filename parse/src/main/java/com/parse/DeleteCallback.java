/**
 * A {@code DeleteCallback} is used to run code after saving a {@link ParseObject} in a background
 * thread.
 *
 * <p>The easiest way to use a {@code DeleteCallback} is through an anonymous inner class. Override
 * the {@code done} function to specify what the callback should do after the delete is complete.
 * The {@code done} function will be run in the UI thread, while the delete happens in a background
 * thread. This ensures that the UI does not freeze while the delete happens.
 *
 * <p>For example, this sample code deletes the object {@code myObject} and calls a different
 * function depending on whether the save succeeded or not.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * myObject.deleteInBackground(new DeleteCallback() {
 *   public void done(ParseException e) {
 *     if (e == null) {
 *       myObjectWasDeletedSuccessfully();
 *     } else {
 *       myObjectDeleteDidNotSucceed();
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
