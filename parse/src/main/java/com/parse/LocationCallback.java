/**
 * A {@code LocationCallback} is used to run code after a Location has been fetched by {@link
 * com.parse.ParseGeoPoint#getCurrentLocationInBackground(long, android.location.Criteria)}.
 *
 * <p>The easiest way to use a {@code LocationCallback} is through an anonymous inner class.
 * Override the {@code done} function to specify what the callback should do after the location has
 * been fetched. The {@code done} function will be run in the UI thread, while the location check
 * happens in a background thread. This ensures that the UI does not freeze while the fetch happens.
 *
 * <p>For example, this sample code defines a timeout for fetching the user's current location, and
 * provides a callback. Within the callback, the success and failure cases are handled differently.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ParseGeoPoint.getCurrentLocationAsync(1000, new LocationCallback() {
 *   public void done(ParseGeoPoint geoPoint, ParseException e) {
 *     if (e == null) {
 *       // do something with your new ParseGeoPoint
 *     } else {
 *       // handle your error
 *       e.printStackTrace();
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 * </pre>
